How long has Mr.Page been teaching? 
```
I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that my former headmaster/ˌhedˈmɑːstə(r)/, Mr.Stuart Pasge, will be retiring/rɪˈtaɪərɪŋ/ next week.

Pupils/ˈpjuːp(ə)lz/ of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion.

All those who have contributed/kənˈtrɪbjuːt/ towards the gift will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster's home.

We shall all remember Mr.Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement/ɪnˈkʌrɪdʒmənt/ he gave us when we went so unwillingly/ʌnˈwɪlɪŋli/ to school.

A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell/ˌfeəˈwel/ dinner in his honour/ˈɒnə(r)/ next Thursday/ˈθɜːzdeɪ/.
 
It is a curious coincidence/kəʊˈɪnsɪdəns/ that the day before his retirement ,Mr.Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years.

After he has retired, he will devote/dɪˈvəʊt/ himself to gardening.

For him, this will be an entirely/ɪnˈtaɪəli/ new hobby/ˈhɒbi/.

But his does not matter, for , as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.
