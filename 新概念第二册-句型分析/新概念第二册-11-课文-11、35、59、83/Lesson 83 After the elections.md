```
The former/ˈfɔːmə(r)/ Prime/praɪm/ Minister/ˈmɪnɪstə(r)/, Mr.Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent/ˈriːsnt/ elections/ɪˈlekʃ(ə)n/.

He is now retiring from political/pəˈlɪtɪk(ə)l/ life and has gone abroad/əˈbrɔːd/.

My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical/fəˈnætɪkl/ opponent/əˈpəʊnənt/ of Mr.Lane's Radial Progressive Party.

After the elections, Patrick/ˈpætrɪk/ went to the former Prime Minister's house.

When he asked if Mr.Lane lived there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.

On the following day, patrick went to the house again.

The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrace, when Patrick asked the same question.

Though a little suspicious/səˈspɪʃəs/ this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.

They day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.

This time, the policeman lost his temper.

'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday' he shouted,

'Mr.Lane was defeated in the elections. He has retried from political life and gone to live abroad!'

'I know' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'
