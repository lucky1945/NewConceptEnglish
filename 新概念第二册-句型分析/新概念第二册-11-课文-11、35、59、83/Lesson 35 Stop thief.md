One of them was carrying a bag full of money.

Roy acted quickly and drove the bus straight at the thieves.

The one with the money got such a fright that he dropped/drɒpt/ the bag.

As the thieves were trying to get away in their car, Roy drove his bus into the back of it.

Shortly afterwards, the police stopped/stɒpt/ the car and both men were arrested/əˈrestɪd/ .
