## First listen and then answer the question
What was the danger to the villages after the fire?

- Heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would coase serious floods as weel
```
Firemen had been fighting the forest/ˈfɒrɪst/ fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under control.

A short/ʃɔːt/ time before, great trees had covered the countryside/ˈkʌntrisaɪd/ for miles around.

Now, smoke still rose up from the warm ground over the desolate hills. 现在，烟雾仍然从温暖的地面上升到荒凉的山丘上。

Winter was coming on and the hills threatened/ˈθret(ə)nd//ˈθretn/ the surrounding villages with destruction/dɪˈstrʌkʃn/, 冬天即将来临，这些山丘对周围的村庄构成了毁灭的威胁，
 
for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil/sɔɪl/ but would cause serious floods/flʌd/ as well.

When the fire had at last been put out,  

the forest authorities/ɔːˈθɒrətiz/ ordered several tons/tʌnz/ of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly.

The seed was sprayed/spred/ over the ground in huge/hjuːdʒ/ quantities/k'wɒntɪtɪz/ by aeroplanes.

The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain.

By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root.

In place of the great trees which had been growing there for centuries/ˈsentʃəriz/,

patches/ˈpætʃɪz/ of green had begun /bɪˈɡʌn/ to appear in the blackened/ˈblækənd/ soil/sɔɪl/.
