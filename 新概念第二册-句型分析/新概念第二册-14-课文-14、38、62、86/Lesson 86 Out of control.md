What was the danger?
```
As the man tried to swing the speedboat round, the steering/ˈstɪərɪŋ/ wheel came away in his hands.

He waved desperately/ˈdespərətli/ to his companion/kəmˈpænjən/, who had been water skiing for the last fifteen minutes.

Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were thrown violently/ˈvaɪələntli/ into the sea.

The speedboat had struck/strʌk/ a buoy/bɔɪ/, but it continued to move very quickly across the water.

Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore, when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in circle.

It now came straight towards them at tremendous/trəˈmendəs/ speed.

In less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away.

After in had passed, they swam/swæm/ on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return.

They had just had enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a cirle.

On this occasion, however, it has slowed down considerably/kənˈsɪdərəbli/-非常，相当多地.

The petrol/ˈpetrəl/ had nearly all been used up.

Before long, the noise dropped completed and the boat began to drift gently/ˈdʒentli/ across the water.
