## First listen and then answer the question
Did the young man speak English?

- Yes, The young man was English himself.
```
I had an amusing /əˈmjuːzɪŋ/ experience /ɪkˈspɪəriəns/ last year.

After I had left a samll village in the south of France/frɑːns/ .

I drove on the next town. 

On they way, a young man waved to me. 

I stoped and he asked me for a lift. 

As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French/frentʃ/ and he replied in same language.

Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all.

Neither of us spoke during /ˈdjʊərɪŋ/ the journey /ˈdʒɜːni/ .

I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?' 

As I soon learnt /lɜːnt/, has was English himself!
