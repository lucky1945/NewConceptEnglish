What was wrong with the man's story?
```
'At the time the murder/ˈmɜːdə(r)/ was committed/kəˈmɪt/, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London' said the man.

'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector/ɪnˈspektə(r)/.

'Of course I do' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My employer/ɪmˈplɔɪə(r)/ will confirm/kənˈfɜːm/ that I was there on time'.

'Would a later/ˈleɪtə(r)/ train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.

'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later/ˈleɪtə(r)/ train.'

'At what time did you arrive at the station?'

'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and wiated for the train.'

'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'

'Of course not'

'I suggest/səˈdʒest/' said the inspector, 

'that you are not telling the truth. I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train, but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time.

You see, on the morning of the murder/ˈmɜːdə(r)/, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It brokw down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line'
