Jeremy Hampden has a large circle of friends and is very popular at parties.

Everybody admires him for his great sense of humour/ˈhjuːmə(r)/ - everybody, that is, 

except his six-year-old daughter, Jenny.

Recently, one of Jeremy's closest friends aksed him to make a speech at a wedding reception/rɪˈsepʃn/.

This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves.

He prepared the speech carefully and went to the wedding with Jenny /ˈdʒeni/.

He had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it was a great success.

As soon as he had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home.

Jeremy was a little disappointed by this but he did as his daughter asked.

On they way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech.

To his surprise, she said she hadn't.

Jeremy asked her why this was so and she told him that she did not like to see so many people laughting at him.
