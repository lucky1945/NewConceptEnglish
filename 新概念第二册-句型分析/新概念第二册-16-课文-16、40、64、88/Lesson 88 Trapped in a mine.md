Why is the rescue/ˈreskjuː_/_  taking so long?
```
Six men have been trapped/træpt/ in a mine/maɪn/ for seventeen hours.

If they are not brought/brɔːt/ to the surface soon they may lose their lives.

However, rescue operations are proving/'pru:viŋ/ difficult.

If explosives/ik'spləusivz/ are used, vibrations/vaɪˈbreɪʃ(ə)nz/ will case/keɪs/ the roof of the mine to collapse/kəˈlæps/.

Rescue workers are therefore drilling/drɪlɪŋ/ a hole on the north side of the mine.

They intend to bring the men up in a special capsule/ˈkæpsjuːl/.

If there had not been a hard layer/ˈleɪə(r)/ of rock beneath/bɪˈniːθ/ the soil/sɔɪl/, they would have completed the job in a few hours.

As it is, they have been drilling/drɪlɪŋ/ for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go.

Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine tow hours ago, has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest/kləusɪst/ relatives/ˈrelətɪvz/.

Though they are running out of food and drink, the man are cheerful/ˈtʃɪəf(ə)l/ and confident that they will get out soon.

They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly.

If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock, they would lose/luːz/ heart/hɑːt/.
