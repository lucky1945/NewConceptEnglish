If you park you car in the wrong place/pleɪs/, a traffic policeman will soon find it.

You will be very lucky if he lets you go without ticket.

However, this does not always happen.

Traffic police/pəˈliːs/ are sometimes very polite/pəˈlaɪt/.

During a holiday in Sweden/ˈswiːdn/, I found/faʊnd/ this note on my car: 

'Sir, we weclome you to our city, This is a "NO Parking" area/ˈeəriə/.

You will enjoy/ɪnˈdʒɔɪ/ your stay here if you pay attention to our/ˈaʊə(r)/ street sings /sɪŋz/.

This note is only a reminder'.
