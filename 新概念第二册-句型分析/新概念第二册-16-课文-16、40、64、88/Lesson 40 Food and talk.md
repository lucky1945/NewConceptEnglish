```

Last week at a dinner party, the hostess/ˈhəʊstəs/ asked/ɑ:skt/ me to sit next to Mrs.Rumbload.

Mrs.Rumbold was large, unsimiling lady in a tight black dress.

She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her.

Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating.

I tried to make conversation.

'A new play is coming to "The Glboe/ɡləʊb/" soon', I said. 'Will you be seeing it?'

'No' she answered.

'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.

'No' she answered.

'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.

'No', she answerd.

In despair/dɪˈspeə(r)/, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.

'Young man', she answered, 'if you ate/et/ more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!'.
