## First listen and then answer the question
Why was the first tunnel not completed?
```
In 1858, a French engineer/ˌendʒɪˈnɪə(r)/, Aime Thome de Gamond,

arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile tunnel/ˈtʌnl/ under the English Channel.

He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the entre of the Channel.

This platform would serve/sɜːv/ as a port and a railway station.

The tunnel would be well-ventilated/ˈventɪleɪt/ if tall/tɔːl/ chimneys were built above sea level.

In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low.

He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.

This would solve/sɒlv/ the problem of ventilation/ˌventɪˈleɪʃn/, 

for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it.

Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun/bɪˈɡʌn/.

If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion/ɪnˈveɪʒn/, it would have been completed.

The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.

It was officially opened on March 7, 1994,

finally connecting Britain/ˈbrɪtn/ to the European continent.
