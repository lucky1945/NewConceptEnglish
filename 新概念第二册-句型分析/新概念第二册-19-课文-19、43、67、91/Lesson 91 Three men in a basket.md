```

A pilot/ˈpaɪlət/ noticed a balloon/bəˈluːn/ which seemed to be making for a Royal/ˈrɔɪəl/ Air Force Station bearby.

He informed the station at once, but no one there was able to explain the mystery.

The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news, 

because ballons can be a great danger to aircraft.

He said that someone might be spying on the station and the pilot/ˈpaɪlət/ was ordered to keep track of the strange object.

The pilot managed to circle/ˈsɜːk(ə)l/ the ballon for some time.

He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars/bɪˈnɒkjələz/.

When the ballon was over the staion, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs.

Soon afterwards/ˈɑːftəwədz/, the ballon began to descend/dɪˈsend/ and it landed near an airfield.

The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone, 

for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the Station!

As the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!
