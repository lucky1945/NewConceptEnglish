Haroun Tazieff, the Polish/ˈpɒlɪʃ/ scientist/ˈsaɪəntɪst/, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes/vɒlˈkeɪnəʊ/ and deep caves in all parts of the world.

In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro.

Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting/ɪˈrʌptɪŋ/ violently/ˈvaɪələntli/.

Though/尽管，让步状语从句/ he managed to take a number of brilliant/ˈbrɪliənt/ photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long.

He noticed that a river of liquid/ˈlɪkwɪd/ rock/rɒk/ was coming towards him.

It threatened/ˈθretn/ to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape/ɪˈskeɪp/ just in time.

He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return teo days later.

This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measures temperatures/ˈtemprətʃə(r)/.

Tazieff has often risked his life in this way.

He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.
