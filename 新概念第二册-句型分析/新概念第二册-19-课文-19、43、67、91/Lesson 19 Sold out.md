'The play may/meɪ/ begin at any moment,' I said.

'It may have begun[bɪˈɡʌn] alreday.' Susan answered.

I hurried to the ticket office. 

'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.

'I'm sorry, we've sold[səʊld] out,' the grid said.

'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed[ɪk'skleɪmd].

Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.

'Can I return these/ðiːz/ two tickets?' he asked.

'Certainly.' the gril said.

I went back to the ticket office at once.

'Could I have those/ðəʊz/  two tickets please?' I asked.

'Certainly.' the gril said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance[pəˈfɔːməns]. 

Do you still want/wɒnt/  them?'

'I might/maɪt/ as well have them,' I said sadly[ˈsædli].
