Busmen/ˈbʌsmən/ have decided/dɪˈsaɪdɪd/ to go on strike next week.

The strike is due to begin on Tuesday/ˈtjuːzdeɪ/.

No one know how long it will last.

The busmen/ˈbʌsmən/ have stated/ˈsteɪtɪd/ that the strike will continue until general/ˈdʒen(ə)rəl/ agreement is reached about pay and working condition.

Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week.

Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides' to pepole on their way to work.

This will relieve/rɪˈliːv/ pressure/ˈpreʃə(r)/ on the trains to some extent/ɪkˈstent/.

Meanwhile, a number of universtiy students have volunteered/ˌvɒlənˈtɪə(r)/ to drive buses while the strike lasts.

All the students are expert/ˈekspɜːt/ drivers, but before they drive any of the buses, they will have to pass a special/ˈspeʃ(ə)l/ test.

The students are going to take the test in two days' time. 

Even so, people are going to find it difficult go get to work.

But so far, the public has expressed its gratitude/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/ to the students in letters to the Press.

Only one or two people have objected/ˈɒbdʒɪkt; əbˈdʒekt/ that the students will drive too fast!
