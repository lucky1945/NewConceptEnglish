```
Our[ɑː(r)] neighbour, Captain Charles/tʃɑːlz/ Alison[ˈælɪsən], 

will sail/seɪl/ from Portsmouth[ˈpɔːtsməθ] tomorrow. 

We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning.

He will be in his small/smɔːl/ boat, Topsail. 

Topsail is a famouse little boat. 

It has sailed across the Atlantic[ətˈlæntɪk] many times.

Captain Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time.

We'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him.

He will be away for two months.

We are very proud of him. 

He will take part in a important race[reɪs] across the Atlantic.
