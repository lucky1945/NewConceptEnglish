As we had had a long walk/wɔːk/ through one of the markets of Old Delhi/ˈdeli/, we stopped/stɒpt/ at a square/skweə(r)/ to have a rest.

After a time, we noticed a snake/sneɪk/ charmer/ˈtʃɑːmə(r)/ with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look at him.

As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe/paɪp/ which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets.

When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake.

It rose/rəʊz/ out of the basket/ˈbɑːskɪt/ and began to follow the movements of the pipe/paɪp/.

We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs.

The snake, however, continued to 'dance'/dɑːns/ slowly.

It obviously/ˈɒbviəsli/ coud not tell the difference between Indian/ˈɪndiən/ music and jazz!
