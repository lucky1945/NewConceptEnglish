Now they have had special cages/ˈkeɪdʒɪz/ made to protect them from these monsters/'mɒnstəz/.

The fish are not sharks/ʃɑːks/ or killer whales/weɪlz/, but favourite eating varieties/vəˈraɪətiz/ like cod/kɒd/ and skate/skeɪt/ which grow to unnatural/ʌnˈnætʃrəl/ size, 

sometimes as tweleve feet in length.

Three factors/'fæktəz/ have caused these fish to grow so large: 

the warm water round the hot oil/ɔɪl/ pipes/paɪps/ under the sea; 

the plentiful/ˈplentɪfl/ supply/səˈplaɪ/ of food thrown overboard/ˈəʊvəbɔːd/ by the crew/kruː/ on the rigs/rɪɡz/;

the total absence/ˈæbsəns/ of fishing boats around the oil rigs.

As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. 

Who eats who?
