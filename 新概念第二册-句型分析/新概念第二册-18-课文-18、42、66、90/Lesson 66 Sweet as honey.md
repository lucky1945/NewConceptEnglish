In 1963 a Lancaster/ˈlæŋkəstə(r)/ bomber/ˈbɒmə(r)/ crashed a Wallis Island, 

a remote/rɪˈməʊt/ place/pleɪs/ in the South Pacific/pəˈsɪfɪk/, a long way west/west/ of Samoa.

The plane/pleɪn/ wasn't too badly damaged, but over the years, 

the crash was forgotten and the wreck/rek/ remained undisturbed/ˌʌndɪˈstɜːbd//not moved or touched by anyone or anything/.

Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash, the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey/ˈsɜːveɪ/ of the island.

By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonable/ˈriːznəbl/ condition was rare and worth rescuing/ˈreskjuːɪŋ/.

The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France.

Now/adverb/ a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored/rɪˈstɔː(r)/.

It has four Roll-Royce Merlin engines, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt.

Imagine their surprise and delight/dɪˈlaɪt/ when they broke open the packing cases and found that fourth engine was sweet as honey 

- still in perfect condition.

A colony of bees had truned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved/prɪˈzɜːvd/ in beeswax!
