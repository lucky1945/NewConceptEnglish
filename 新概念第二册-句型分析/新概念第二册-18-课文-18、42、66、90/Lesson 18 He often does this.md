After I had had lunch/lʌntʃ/ at a village pub, I looked for my bag.

I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there!

As I was looking for it, the landlord came/keɪm/ in. 

'Did you have a good meal?' he asked/ɑ:skt/.

'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't/kɑːnt/ pay the bill, I haven't got my bag.'

The landlord/ˈlændlɔːd/ smiled and immediately went out. 

In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

'I'm very sorry.' he said, 'My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!'
