
Who made the only funny joke that evening and why?
```
People will do anything to see a free show - even if it is a bad one.

When the news got round that a comedy/ˈkɒmədi/ show would be presented/prɪˈzentɪd/ at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company, we all rushed to see it.

We had to queue/kjuː/ for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.

Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest/dʌl/ we have even seen.

Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come.

The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser/ˈædvətaɪzə(r)/ at the beginning of the programme/ˈprəʊɡræm/.

He was obviously every nervous and for some mintues stood awkwardly/ˈɔːkwədli/ before the microphone.

As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst/bɜːst/ out laughing.

We all know what the poor man should have said, but what he actually said was: 

'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company. Goodd ladies, evening and gentlemen!'
