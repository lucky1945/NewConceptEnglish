## Notes on the text

- We mustn't buy things we don't need.
   - need是普通动词，当需要讲。

- You needn't have said that
   - 虚拟 - needn't have done 表示本不用做，但实际上做了。
   - 虚拟 - need have done 表示本可以做，但是没做。
   - 真实 - needn't do  不需要做，就真的不做。


- A woman can't have too many hats.
   - A man can never have too many ties.
   - too的意思和so,such都是"很"的意思,加强程度
        too和so such的区别是
        too所带有的意味是"太多 太过了" 一种过分的意思.
        而so such没有这种意味,仅仅起加强的作用.
        所以这句话假如说成
        A man has too many ties.就是说一个男人的领带太多了(有一种抱怨 嫌弃的情感)
        若加上can never说成A man can never have too many ties.
        直译为 "一个男人从来不会有太多的领带"(再多也不过分)
        所以根据句意 意译为男人有多少领带也不宪多.
        翻译好这类句子主要体会"too"这个词的情感
        类似的句子有 You can never drive too slow.
        翻译为 你车开的再慢也不为过(即提醒小心驾车,不要怕开慢了
