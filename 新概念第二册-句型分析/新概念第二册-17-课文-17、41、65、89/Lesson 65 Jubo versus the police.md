## First listen and then answer the question
Why did the police have to push Jumbo off the main street?
```
Last/lɑːst/ Christmas/ˈkrɪsməs/, the circus owner, Jimmy/ˈdʒɪmi/ Gates/ˈɡeɪts/, decided to take some presents to a children's hospital.

Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanied/əˈkʌmpənid/ by a 'guard of honour/ˈɒnə(r)/' of six pretty girls,

he set off/to begin a journey/ the down the main street of the city raiding a baby elephant called Jumbo.

He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing.

A policeman approached/əˈprəʊtʃt/ Jimmy and told him he ough to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic.

Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo/ˈdʒʌmbəʊ/ refused to move.

Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street.

The police had a difficult time,  but they were most amused.

'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate/ˈfɔːtʃənət/ that we didn't have to carry him. 

Of course, we should arrest him, but as/conj 因为/ he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.'
